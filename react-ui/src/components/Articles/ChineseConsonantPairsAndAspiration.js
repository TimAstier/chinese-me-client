          <h1>Chinese Consonant Pairs and Aspiration</h1>

          This week we meet Johan in Stockholm who shares with us one of the keys to understand Chinese pronunciation: aspiration and voicing.

          Here are two takeaways from this video:

          <h2>Unlike many other languages, Chinese consonants are all <i>unvoiced</i></h2>
        </c.Bookrow>
        <c.P>
          If you pronounce b- and p- in English and hold the palm of your hand on your Adamâ€™s apple, you can notice that the main difference between b- and p- is that b- is <i>voiced</i> (you can feel a vibration), whereas p- is <i>unvoiced</i> (there is no vibration).

          <h2>Chinese consonant pairs are distinguished with <i>aspiration</i></h2>
        </c.Bookrow>
        <c.P>
          Instead of this <i>voiced vs. unvoiced</i> distinction, many Chinese consonant pairs are distinguished with another concept called <i>aspiration</i>.
        </c.P>
        <c.P>
          In Chinese, both -b and -p are <i>unvoiced</i> (no vibration). But if you place your hand or a piece of paper if front of your month, you should feel a strong flow of air when pronouncing -p, whereas the flow of air is much weaker when pronouncing -b.
        </c.P>
        <c.P>
          Knowing that Chinese consonants are mostly distinguished based on aspiration can help you a lot if you want to master Chinese pronunciation and sound like a native speaker.
